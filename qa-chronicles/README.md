# QA Chronicles

Welcome to **QA Chronicles** – a dedicated space for documenting my journey into the world of Quality Assurance. This repository covers everything from learning how to write effective test cases, automation strategies, interview preparation, tooling, best practices, and reflections from real-world QA experiences.

## 📖 Why QA Chronicles?

This is more than just documentation — it's a personal learning archive, a knowledge base, and a reflection journal all rolled into one. Whether you're just starting out in QA or looking to sharpen your testing mindset, I hope this serves as a useful resource.
